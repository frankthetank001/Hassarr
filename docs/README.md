# Hassarr Integration

Hassarr is a custom Home Assistant integration to add movies and TV shows to Radarr, Sonarr and Overseerr with advanced LLM (Large Language Model) integration for natural language interactions.

## ðŸš€ LLM Agentic Integration

This integration is designed for **LLM agentic actions** rather than traditional conversation triggers. Your LLM receives a list of available actions and can call services directly, interpreting the structured responses for natural language interactions.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Flexible Natural Language**: No rigid command patterns required
- **Context Awareness**: LLM can maintain conversation context  
- **Rich Responses**: Structured data enables detailed, natural responses
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types for appropriate LLM responses

See the [LLM Integration Examples](#llm-integration-examples) section below for implementation details.

## Requirements

* You must have Home Assistant OS or Home Assistant Core installed (I only tested it on Home Assistant Core)
* HACS installed on Home Assistant (instructions below for Home Assistant Core in Docker)

## Installation

### Installing HACS on Home Assistant Core in Docker
1) SSH into your server (if you have one)
2) SSH into your homeassistant docker container
`docker exec -it <your_container_name> bash`
3) Run the following command to install HACS
`wget -O - https://get.hacs.xyz | bash -`
4) Exit from the docker container
`exit`
4) Restart the docker container
`docker-compose restart <your_container_name>`
5) Add the HACS integration by going to <your_hass_ip>:<your_hass_port>/config/integrations/dashboard on the browser
6) Press "+ Add Integration"
7) Look up "HACS"
8) Read and check all the boxes and Add

Now you should have the HACS button showing on the left menu, which should bring you to the HACS dashboard

### Install Hassarr on HACS
1) Press the button to add this custom repo to HACS
[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=frankthetank001&repository=Hassarr&category=Integration)
2) Now look up "Hassarr" in the HACS Store search bar and download it
3) Restart your home assistant again for Hassarr to be properly added: `docker-compose restart <your_container_name>`
4) Add Hassarr to your Home Assistant integrations: <your_hass_ip>:<your_hass_port>/config/integrations/dashboard
5) Press "+ Add Integration"
6) Look up "Hassarr" and select it
7) It should prompt you to pick either Radarr & Sonarr, or Overseerr. Pick whichever service(s) you want to use and follow the instructions.
8a) For Radarr & Sonarr, after filling in the urls and api keys, it will prompt you with the quality profiles you want to use for each service.
8b) For Overseerr, after filling in the urls and api keys, it will prompt you with the Overseerr user you want to use for making requests. 

Now Hassarr should be installed, and you can create an Automation or Intent to have sentences trigger downloads on Sonarr and Radarr.

}
```

### Automation Approaches

#### 1. LLM Agentic Approach (Recommended)
Instead of conversation triggers, your LLM directly calls services:

```yaml
# LLM receives user query: "What's the status of The Matrix?"
# LLM calls: hassarr.check_media_status with title="The Matrix"
# LLM interprets structured response and responds naturally
```

#### 2. Traditional Conversation Triggers (Legacy)
For backward compatibility, you can still use conversation triggers:

```yaml
- alias: "Check Movie Status"
  trigger:
    - platform: conversation
      command:
        - "What's the status of {title}"
        - "Check status of {title}"
  action:
    - service: hassarr.check_media_status
      data:
        title: "{{ trigger.slots.title }}"
```

#### Get Active Downloads (Service-Based)
```yaml
- alias: "Check Active Downloads"
  trigger:
    - platform: conversation
      command:
        - "What's downloading"
        - "Show active downloads"
        - "What's in the queue"
  action:
    - service: hassarr.get_active_requests
```

#### Get Active Downloads (Sensor-Based - Recommended)
```yaml
- alias: "Check Active Downloads - Sensor Based"
  trigger:
    - platform: conversation
      command:
        - "What's downloading"
        - "Show active downloads"
        - "What's in the queue"
  action:
    - service: persistent_notification.create
      data:
        title: "Download Status"
        message: |
          **Active Downloads:** {{ states('sensor.hassarr_active_downloads') }}
          **Queue Status:** {{ states('sensor.hassarr_download_queue_status') }}
          **Connection:** {{ states('binary_sensor.hassarr_overseerr_online') }}
          
          {% set download_details = state_attr('sensor.hassarr_active_downloads', 'download_details') %}
          {% if download_details %}
            **Current Downloads:**
            {% for download in download_details %}
            - {{ download.title }}: {{ download.downloads }} files
            {% endfor %}
          {% endif %}
```

#### Remove Media
```yaml
- alias: "Remove Media"
  trigger:
    - platform: conversation
      command:
        - "Remove {media_id} from overseerr"
        - "Delete media {media_id}"
  action:
    - service: hassarr.remove_media
      data:
        media_id: "{{ trigger.slots.media_id }}"
```

## How do I add an Automation, and what is an Automation (for noobies)?

Good question! I'm not even sure entirely what Automations are capable of precisely, but with Hassarr you're able to map a sentence to a Hassarr action, like Add Movie or Add TV Show.

You can set something up like "Add {some_title} to Radarr for me please" and this will trigger it to download your title on Radarr.

There's two ways of adding this, through the UI or directly into your automations.yaml file.

### Adding Automations in the UI (Legacy Conversation Triggers)
**Note**: This approach uses conversation triggers. For LLM agentic integration, see the examples above.

1) In Home Assistant, go to Settings > Automations & Scenes > + Create Automation > Create New Automation
2) + Add Trigger > Sentence, and fill in something like this `Download {title} for me on radar`. It's important to write `radar` instead of `radarr` as your speech-to-text will always transcribe the spoken word `radar` to `radar`, and not with `rr`. Add multiple sentences if you want multiple phrases to trigger it to add a movie to Radarr. Same applies to Sonarr or Overseerr.
3) + Add Action > Type in `Hassarr` > Select `Hassarr: add_movie` > Press the three vertical dots > `Edit in YAML` > and fill in the following into the YAML editor
    ```
    action: hassarr.add_radarr_movie
    metadata: {}
    data:
      title: "{{ trigger.slots.title }}"
    ```
4) Hit Save, give it a name like `Add Movie to Radarr`
5) Repeat steps 1-4 for Sonarr (or do it for Overseerr for movies and tv shows, if you prefer)

Now you should be able to add a movie or TV show to Radarr and Sonarr using the sentences you setup!

### Adding Automations in YAML (Legacy Conversation Triggers)
**Note**: This approach uses conversation triggers. For LLM agentic integration, see the examples above.

1) Open the `automations.yaml` in your home assistant's `config` directory, or wherever you mount your home assistant's docker container
2) Paste in the following
```
- id: '1734867354703'
  alias: Add movie using Assist
  description: ''
  triggers:
  - trigger: conversation
    command:
    - (Download|Add|Send) movie {title} [on|to]  [radarr|radar]
    - (Baixa|Adiciona|Envia)[r] [o] filme {title} [no|ao|para o|para] [radarr|radar]
  conditions: []
  actions:
  - action: hassarr.add_radarr_movie
    metadata: {}
      data:
        title: ""{{ trigger.slots.title }}""
  mode: single
```
You can change the sentences in `command: ` to whatever sentences you like, add more etc.
3) Save the file, and you're good to go.
4) Make a copy of this for Sonarr (or for Overseerr, one for movies and one for tv shows, if you so prefer)

### Advanced LLM Integration Examples

#### Comprehensive Status Check (LLM Agentic)
```yaml
# LLM receives: "What's the status of The Matrix?"
# LLM calls: hassarr.check_media_status with title="The Matrix"
# LLM interprets structured response and responds naturally
```

#### Queue Management (LLM Agentic)
```yaml
# LLM receives: "What's downloading right now?"
# LLM calls: hassarr.get_active_requests
# LLM interprets structured response and responds naturally
```

#### Legacy Conversation Triggers (Not Recommended)
```yaml
- alias: "Smart Media Status Check"
  trigger:
    - platform: conversation
      command:
        - "What's the status of {title}"
        - "Check {title}"
        - "Is {title} downloading"
  action:
    - service: hassarr.check_media_status
      data:
        title: "{{ trigger.slots.title }}"
    - service: persistent_notification.create
      data:
        title: "Media Status"
        message: |
          {% set result = states('input_text.last_status_check') %}
          {% if result %}
            {{ result }}
          {% else %}
            Status check completed. Check logs for details.
          {% endif %}
```

## Integration Approaches

### LLM Agentic Approach (Recommended)
- **Pros**: Flexible natural language, context awareness, rich responses, no rigid patterns
- **Cons**: Requires LLM integration setup
- **Best for**: Natural language interactions, conversational AI, flexible user queries
- **How it works**: LLM receives user query â†’ Calls appropriate service â†’ Interprets structured response â†’ Responds naturally

### Sensor-Based Approach (For Background Context)
- **Pros**: Automatic updates, reactive automations, Home Assistant native, better performance
- **Cons**: Less detailed data, requires polling intervals
- **Best for**: Monitoring, dashboards, reactive automations, providing context to LLM

### Service-Based Approach (For Direct Control)
- **Pros**: Direct control, immediate responses, detailed data
- **Cons**: Requires manual service calls, no automatic updates, more complex automations
- **Best for**: One-time queries, detailed status checks, specific media searches

### Hybrid Approach (Best of All)
- Use LLM agentic approach for natural language interactions
- Use sensors for background monitoring and context
- Use services for detailed queries and specific actions
- Combine all three for comprehensive media management

## Service Response Actions

The LLM-focused services return specific action types that can be used for conditional logic:

### Status Check Actions
- `found_media` - Media found with detailed information
- `not_found` - No media found matching search criteria
- `connection_error` - Failed to connect to Overseerr
- `missing_title` - No search title provided

### Request Management Actions
- `active_requests_found` - Active requests found with download progress
- `no_active_requests` - No active requests in queue
- `media_removed` - Media successfully removed
- `removal_failed` - Failed to remove media

### Search Actions
- `search_results` - Search results found
- `details_found` - Media details retrieved successfully

## Sensor Attributes

The sensor entities provide rich attributes for detailed information:

### `sensor.hassarr_active_downloads`
- **State**: Number of active downloads
- **Attributes**:
  - `total_requests`: Total number of requests in queue
  - `last_update`: Timestamp of last update
  - `download_details`: Array of download information including:
    - `title`: Media title
    - `type`: Media type (movie/tv)
    - `downloads`: Number of files downloading
    - `progress`: Array of progress details for each download

### `sensor.hassarr_download_queue_status`
- **State**: Human-readable queue status (e.g., "3 active, 5 total")
- **Attributes**:
  - `active_downloads`: Number of active downloads
  - `total_requests`: Total requests in queue
  - `overseerr_online`: Connection status
  - `last_update`: Timestamp of last update

### `binary_sensor.hassarr_downloads_active`
- **State**: `on` when downloads are active, `off` when none
- **Attributes**: Same as active_downloads sensor

### `binary_sensor.hassarr_overseerr_online`
- **State**: `on` when connected, `off` when disconnected
- **Attributes**:
  - `last_update`: Timestamp of last update
  - `connection_status`: "connected" or "disconnected"

## Configuration

The integration stores results in `hass.data[f"{DOMAIN}_results"]` for potential use by other components:

- `last_status_check` - Result of last status check
- `last_removal` - Result of last media removal
- `last_requests` - Result of last active requests check
- `last_search` - Result of last media search
- `last_details` - Result of last media details retrieval

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Errors**: Ensure your Overseerr URL and API key are correct
2. **No Results**: Check that the media title is spelled correctly
3. **Permission Errors**: Verify your Overseerr user has appropriate permissions
4. **Service Not Found**: Restart Home Assistant after installation

### Debugging

Enable debug logging by adding to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.hassarr: debug
```
