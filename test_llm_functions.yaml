# Testing the new Hassarr LLM functions

# After setting up the integration, your LLM should be able to call these functions:

# 1. HassarrAddMedia - Add movies/TV shows
# Example: "Add The Dark Knight to my library"
# LLM will call: HassarrAddMedia(title="The Dark Knight")

# 2. HassarrCheckStatus - Check media status  
# Example: "What's the status of Inception?"
# LLM will call: HassarrCheckStatus(title="Inception")

# 3. HassarrSearchMedia - Search for media
# Example: "Search for Christopher Nolan movies"
# LLM will call: HassarrSearchMedia(query="Christopher Nolan movies")

# 4. HassarrGetActiveDownloads - Get current downloads
# Example: "What's downloading right now?"
# LLM will call: HassarrGetActiveDownloads()

# 5. HassarrTestConnection - Test system status
# Example: "How is my media server?"
# LLM will call: HassarrTestConnection()

# To verify the functions are available:
# 1. Go to Settings > Devices & Services > Hassarr
# 2. Check that the integration is loaded without errors
# 3. Check Home Assistant logs for "Hassarr LLM API registered successfully"
# 4. Your LLM should now see these functions available for media management

# Manual testing via Developer Tools (if your LLM supports it):
# You can also test these by configuring your LLM to call the functions manually
# or by using a conversation agent that can make function calls.

# The functions return structured JSON responses optimized for LLM interpretation,
# allowing your chat assistant to provide detailed, natural language responses
# about your media library status and operations.
